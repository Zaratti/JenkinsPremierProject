**JenkinsPremierProject: Forecasting Antimalarial Drug Needs**
**Project Overview**
The JenkinsPremierProject aims to forecast the demand for antimalarial drugs in Africa. Malaria remains a significant public health challenge, particularly affecting children under the age of five. Accurate forecasting of drug needs is crucial for effective resource allocation and planning.

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to provide robust predictions of antimalarial drug requirements across the continent. This involves modeling complex variables that affect drug demand, such as seasonal outbreaks, population growth, and improvements in healthcare access.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains the following columns:

Subdomain
ISO
Countries and areas
Key
UNICEF Reporting Region
UNICEF Programme Region
World Bank Income Group (2022)
Year
Population_growth(%)
% of children under age 5 with fever
... (other columns)
**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning models for prediction.
Model Training: Training the selected models on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as R-squared.
**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Flask
**Results**
Ridge Regression: R-squared = 0.999
... (other models and their performance metrics)
Conclusion
The JenkinsPremierProject demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to forecast antimalarial drug needs in Africa. Accurate predictions can help healthcare organizations and policymakers make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively.
